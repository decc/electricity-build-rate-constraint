        This scenario results in&nbsp;<span class='output' data-format='.2p' data-name='n_2020_renewables_target'></span>&nbsp;renewable electricity in 2020
      </h2>
      We assume that between now and 2020
      <span class='draggable output' data-format='.1f' data-name='build_rate_from_now_to_2020' max='12' min='0' step='0.1' value='10'></span>

      of that capacity is wind. This leads to
      <span class='output' data-format='.0f' data-name='n_2020_renewables_target_twh'></span>
      TWh of renewable electricity in 2020 (i.e.,<span class='output' data-format='.2p' data-name='n_2020_renewables_target'></span>) compared with our indicative target of 105 TWh (30%).
      <!-- / DELAYED BUILD -->
      <h2>
        Additional low-carbon generation is delayed until
        <span class='output' data-format='.0f' data-name='year_second_wave_of_building_starts'></span>
      </h2>
      <p>
        We assume that we want to delay construction of further low-carbon electricity until the last possible moment, but still decarbonise electricity by 2050 in order to meet our legally binding target. How late we can leave it depends on the fastest we can imagine building low-carbon electricity. In this case we we assume that, at most,
        <span class='draggable output' data-format='.1f' data-name='build_rate_target_in_second_build' max='12' min='0' step='0.1' type='range' value='0'></span>
        GW of low carbon capacity can be built each year, and that the maximum rate at which the low carbon construction industry can expand is
        <span class='draggable output' data-format='p' data-name='maximum_industry_expansion' max='1' min='0' step='0.05' type='range' value='0.5'></span>
        a year. This means that new low-carbon capacity doesn't need to start generating until
        <span class='output' data-format='.0f' data-name='year_second_wave_of_building_starts'></span>
        in order for electricity to more-or-less decarbonise by 2050.
      </p>
      <p>
        One critical assumption is that
        <span class='draggable output' data-format='p' data-name='proportion_of_second_build_that_is_wind' max='1' min='0' step='0.01' type='range' value='0.0'>of the</span>
        low-carbon capacity that is subsequently built is wind. This is important because wind delivers less energy per GW of capacity than nuclear, CCS or bioenergy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have also assumed that, after 2020, the rate of low-carbon construction falls by at most
        <span class='draggable output' data-format='p' data-name='maximum_industry_contraction' max='1' min='0' step='0.05' type='range' value='1'></span>
        in any given year, and never falls below
        <span class='draggable output' data-format='.1f' data-name='minimum_build_rate' max='10' min='0' step='0.5' type='range' value='0.5'></span>
        GW per year.

      <p>
        If emissions from heavy industry and electricity generation exceed the UK's share of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme cap (assumed to be 860 MtCO2e over the 4th Carbon Budget period 2023-2027) then allowances will need to be purchased from other EU countries. To estimate this purchase, we assume that industrial emissions grow at
